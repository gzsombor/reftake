# RefTake

**RefTake** is a non-owning alternative to [`std::io::Take`] that allows limiting how many bytes can be read from a referenced reader without taking ownership of it.

It is useful in scenarios where:
- You need to apply a byte limit to an existing borrowed reader.
- Youâ€™re implementing stream parsers or protocols where ownership cannot be moved.
- You want to reuse a single reader across multiple limited reads.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… Works with any type implementing `Read` or `BufRead`
- âœ… Does not take ownership â€” wraps `&mut R` instead of consuming `R`
- âœ… `Read` and `BufRead` implementations respect the byte limit
- âœ… Supports dynamic limit adjustment via `.set_limit()`
- âœ… Extension trait to simplify usage: `.take_ref(limit)`

## ðŸ“¦ Usage

### Add to your project

Add it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
reftake = "0.1"
```

### Example

```rust
use std::io::{Cursor, Read};
use ref_take::RefTakeExt;

fn main() {
    let mut reader = Cursor::new(b"hello world");
    let mut limited = (&mut reader).by_ref_take(5);

    let mut buffer = String::new();
    limited.read_to_string(&mut buffer).unwrap();
    assert_eq!(buffer, "hello");
}
```
